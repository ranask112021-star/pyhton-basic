# Chapter 6 Conditional Expressions
# Sometimes we want to play PUBG on our phone if the day is Sunday.
# Sometimes we order Ice Cream Online if the day is Sunny.

# Sometimes we go hiking if our parents allow.
# All these decisions which depend on a condition being met.
# In Python programming too, We must be able to execute instructions on a condtion(s) being met.
# This is what conditionals are for!.


# If ELSE  and ELIF Statements in Python

# If else and Elif statement are multiway decision taken by our program due to certin conditions in our code.

# Synatx

#if (condition): # if conditionis True.
 #   print("Yes") #yes
    
#elif(condition2): #  if condition2 is True
  #  print("No") # no
#else:   # otherwise
 #   print("Maybe") 
    
    
# RELATIONAL OPERATORS
# Relational Operators are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statements.some example of relational operator are:
# ==: equal.
# > = : greater than / equal to.
# < = : lesser  then / equal to.

# LOGICAL OPERATORS

# In python logical operator operate on conditional Example:
#  . and - true if both operator are true else false.
# . or - true if at least one operand is true or else false.
# . not - inverts true to false & false to true.
